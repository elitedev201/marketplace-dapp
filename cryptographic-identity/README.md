# What is Decentraland?

Decentraland is a virtual world owned by its users.

Modeled after some of the most interesting developments of the past decades, it's a consensus-system to get a render of a shared space.

Assets are owned by an Ethereum Address.

-> see [Address.ts](Address.ts)

Addresses are controlled either by a smart contract on the ethereum blockchain, or by an "externally owned account", a Cryptographic identity:

-> see [CryptographicIdentity.ts](CryptographicIdentity.ts)

With a Cryptographic Identity, one can sign messages

-> see [SignedMessage.ts](SignedMessage.ts)

Messages can be chained together to create chained certificates of claims.

-> see [ChainedCertificate.ts](ChainedCertificate.ts)
